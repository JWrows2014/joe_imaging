The images used in the repository are from my personal x-rays taken in 2024. The PDF slide deck was created using Quarto in RStudio and images were extracted from either DICOM files (using pydicom in Python) or PDF files (using pymupdf in Python), depending on what health care providers gave me.

* Knee x-rays: taken due to pain caused by gout
* Shoulder x-rays: taken due prednisone induced avascular necrosis
* Hand x-rays: taken due to tophaceous gout
